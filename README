Tangram::Object version 1.?
===========================

Tangram::Object serves to provide a base class for deriving Tangram
objects from.

In some ways, it is similar to Class::Contract, but it allows
finer-grained specification of the types of attributes.  This is
particularly useful if you are using Tangram, but consider it an
"alternate approach" to Class::Contract, that supports persistence
without using Data::Dumper/Storable.
