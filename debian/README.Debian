This is the Debianized version of Sam Vilain's Class::Tangram perl
module.

It has nothing to do with the Debian project, other than it is using
their package format, and designed to integrate with Debian (designed
for woody, but should work on Sarge, Sid, etc. assuming some other
alpha piece of shite library on that platform doesn't break it).

See http://vilain.net/pm/ for a more up-to-date copy, or add the
following to your /etc/apt/sources.list;
