Description:  create constructors, accessor and update methods for
 Class::Tangram is a base class originally intended for use with
 Tangram objects, that gives you free constructors, access methods,
 update methods, and a destructor that should help in breaking circular
 references for you. Type checking is achieved by parsing the schema
 for the object, which is contained within the object class in an
 exported variable $schema.
 .
 After writing this I found that it was useful for merely adding type
 checking and validation to arbitrary objects.  There are several
 modules on CPAN to do that already, but many don't have finely grained
 type checking, and none of them integrated with Tangram.
